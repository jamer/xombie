Non-engineering jobs:
	* Additional or higher quality artwork/graphics.
	* Free (as in speech) sound effects and music.

Long term TODO list:
	* Terrain.
	* Levels/cities (have to be dynamic).
	* Overhead view of map.
	* Inventory/InventoryView.
	* Improve AI.
	* Improve music control functions; ability to change tracks maybe?
	* Improve item spawning system (!!)
	* Add -full- OpenGL support (that means converting images to OpenGL
	  textures, using OGL functions [glRotatef() for example] etc.)
	* Add mob subsystem with prototype factory.
	* Made WorldView viewport center on player. (Probably requires terrain 
	  support.)
	* Mobs drop items. Mobs drop weapons!
	* Separate Item from its representation in World and Inventory.
	  e.g. - ItemClass, ItemSpecifics?
	  Definitely remove Sprite superclass.

Short term TODO list:
	* Change Sprite.move() to include an angle parameter.
	* AI needs to follow player.
	* Audio needs to play more than just a static "Music 1."
	* Re-randomize item spawn locations.
	* Do a little research on rotating OpenGL textures for a replacement to
	  SDL_gfx.
	* Give guns limited ammo, with ammo pickups.

Half or semi-implemented:
	* Inventory{,view}
	* Mob{,Factory,Prototype} (need to redo Sprite for this... *sigh*)
	* OpenGL rendering
