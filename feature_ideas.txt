3d?
	- map gen can handle multiple layers of tiles
	- camera movement API
	- try out blender tutorials
	- direct SDL GL rendering

random map generator

pre defined in map segment part:
	- exits
	- mob spawns
	- item spawn
	- chest spawns
	- barrel spawns
	- mob generators

map guidance files:
	- lists of pre-defined map segment parts:
		- possible starting segments
		- possible ending segments
	- guidance for map style:
		- long corridor
		- large expanse
		- parallel paths
	- meta-patterns?
how to do never-ending expanse?

ideas for map segments:
	- traps:
		- time interval based
		- pressure based
		- sight based
	- tilesets:
		- jungle:
			- stone ziggurats
			- stone totem poles
		- hell (!??)
		- plains/fields:
			- wigwams
		- dungeon
		- (crystal?) cavern:
			- water pools
		- forest

separate engine from modules:
	- engine:
		- should have all OS-specific code
	- lists modules that it can load
	- loads a module

modules:
	- list:
		- xombie
		- diablo clone:
			- character-specific stash:
				- holds items for you, used to hold items you can use in the future
				- bank, secures your gold so you don't lose it on death
			- account-wide shared stash between characters

	- distributed in MPQ file
		- Linux and Windows binary included:
			- located in /bin
			- platforms.txt lists ones included
		- all resource files
		- localization files
		- can be overridden to use filesystem if file newer by date?

start development on windows

unique monsters:
	- larger size
	- extra strong
	- extra fast
	- releases spell upon being hit
	- slows/slows upon being hit
	- burns/burns upon being hit
	- shocks/shocks upon being hit
	- minions

items:
	- unique items
	- stacks of items
	- unidentified
	- sets
	- random item attributes:
		- generic:
			- increased movement speed
			- max health/mana bonus
			- passive health/mana regen
			- gold drop bonus
			- magic item % drop bonus
		- armor:
			- armor class bonus
			- block bonus
		- weapon:
			- damage bonus
			- to hit bonus
			- health/mana steal
	- barrels:
		- like to come in large groups
		- hold nothing/few items
		- might be a trap (lone barrels will be traps more often than groups of barrels):
			- explode
			- cast spell
			- generate enemy (skeleton/zombie)
	- chests:
		- hold lots of items
		- glowy/gold chests hold more
		- can be a mimic in disguise, will attack player
		- mimics hold even more items than gold chests

random item tables, like diablo 2

pause game
pause only mobs/players
pause only spells/abilities

party:
	- follows you around
	- wanders a little, though
	- aggresive/defensive/passive?

mana/energy?
skills/stats

gold
shops
towns

loading screen?

menus:
	- main menu
	- settings menu

quests?

inventory:
	- spacious:
		- items take up space in a visual grid
		- bigger items take up more space
	- paper doll for equipt items
	- max carry weight, in addition to max space


external quest designer that quest developer could use, perferably GUI

use YAML to store data:
	- random item tables?
	- saved games



Violetland ideas:

Share your spontaneous ideas for new items/powerups/monsterdrops!

* flare <http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Flare_0.jpg> - gets
dropped randomly by dead monsters and ignites instantly or by walking
over it. it will light an area around it (and play an ignition sound
when lit <http://opengameart.org/content/flare-ignition>) for 3/4ths
of a day. Alternatively one can pick them up and drop them (but that
would require one more key the player needs to learn to use).

* invisibility - monsters won't notice the player while he is
invisible but hurt him if he runs into them. Alternatively they can be
made to see him if he attacks them.

What spontaneous ideas do you have? :)

PS: Hope it finally works to post..

------------------------------------

Also we can share ideas for perks and types of weapon.

I want to see some jumps in game (may be like in unreal tournament by
double key press).

I think about some perk for laser weapon - few additional short rays
will thrown when a ray cuts an enemy. Prism.

I like flares, I think it is possible to expand inventory of
violetland by flares in additional to grenades. But I'm using standard
opengl lights for lighting and there can be only 8 lights at same time
(including flashlight of course). So I should to control Violet
operations with flares or to use some another technology.

-----------------------------------------

for new items and perks, we can take a look at the original
crimsonland. i thought the goal is just to clone crimsonland, this
gives some limitations, to what we should do next.
i also think its a good idea to actually clone it and then we can go
on, so that at least we have a "crimson violet" game-mode.

i collected all the ideas, that came up in my mind and wrote them
down. its not only perks/items and some of them extend the origin
crimsonland by far, so just take a look and comment but better dont
start to make it now. (its quite a workload too)



i always see (esp. with shotgun) that you are hitting an area, not a
single point so it might be possible to determine the distance between
bullet-impact and centre (they have already hit-rotation). this could
be useful for hit/death-left/right animation and also for
headshots ;) ... ough, i just realized that at least you need to know
if the monsters front or side face is pointing to you to make hit/
death animation in realistic direction.

i saw you want to make a particle system, which is awesome for bullets
hitting the ground (or whatever) ... you could add the ability to aim
on the ground to hit crouching monsters, like spiders (or legless/
crippled zombies). the possibility to shoot outside of the screen
should be kept, so maybe, hold down a key to hit the ground.

how about an auto-aiming mechanism, you know, select nearest enemy,
aim to it, trigger. a lot of things build on that like civilians and
even new monsters, maybe new perks and items (this lightning or
imagine autofire-turrets).

or how about mirrored pictures or slow-motion to give alot of
animations more variety. this is a better solution for hit/death left/
right too.

slow playback of sounds is nice too = bigger monster -> longer and
deeper roar, bullet-time. apropos sound: more far away the source of
sound, more quiet playback.

a more realistic flash-light that en lights an expanding cylinder in
the direction you point AND that only shows the first monster with
full bright. all the following monsters get 50% brightness of the
previous one, so that you only see some, not all monsters (i think the
behaviour of flash-light is veeery important for gameplay).

how about a weapon-heat indicator that disallows to continue shooting
when weapon is too hot (maybe weapon malfunction too?). i mean two new
weapon-attributes and shot-counter, this could also be used for player-
screams, e.g. you have emptied your 2nd round/clip with ongoing firing
and there are still n monsters alive so player starts to make a war-
scream (btw player could say something like "ohh shit" when reloading
while monster is close or n monsters are visible).

also a new weapon attribute could be weapon-weight that effects
running speed. when we make a minigun, it should have a disadvantage.

a stance system: you have a melee-stance that also lets you run faster
(or sprint as long as your "power-bar" is full, melee combat is useful
if we limit the amount of player ammo) and a weapon-stance in which
you can shoot.

weather-effects. rain with lightning-flash, fog, and storm that
distracts bullets and slows down movement in one direction.

when dead, the screen could slowly fade to black, credits scroll from
down to upside and a unique music is played. this movie character
would be good for atmospheric rpg i think.


ps. player-death ani is nearly ready. i was not able to use blender
physics-engine so i had to do it frame by frame and therefore its
not ... RL-realistic.

------------------------------------------------

oh oh, some spntaneous ideas about perks ... ok they are obvious.

acid bullets = 1/3 more dmg per bullet.
tightwad = 20% more bullets in one clip.
stealth = decreased range, at which zombies turn to you and attack
