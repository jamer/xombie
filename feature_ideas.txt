3d?
	- map gen can handle multiple layers of tiles
	- camera movement API
	- try out blender tutorials
	- direct SDL GL rendering

random map generator

pre defined in map segment part:
	- exits
	- mob spawns
	- item spawn
	- chest spawns
	- barrel spawns
	- mob generators

map guidance files:
	- lists of pre-defined map segment parts:
		- possible starting segments
		- possible ending segments
	- guidance for map style:
		- long corridor
		- large expanse
		- parallel paths
	- meta-patterns?
how to do never-ending expanse?

ideas for map segments:
	- traps:
		- time interval based
		- pressure based
		- sight based
	- tilesets:
		- jungle:
			- stone ziggurats
			- stone totem poles
		- hell (!??)
		- plains/fields:
			- wigwams
		- dungeon
		- (crystal?) cavern:
			- water pools
		- forest

separate engine from modules:
	- engine:
		- should have all OS-specific code
	- lists modules that it can load
	- loads a module

modules:
	- list:
		- xombie
		- diablo clone:
			- character-specific stash:
				- holds items for you, used to hold items you can use in the future
				- bank, secures your gold so you don't lose it on death
			- account-wide shared stash between characters

	- distributed in MPQ file
		- Linux and Windows binary included:
			- located in /bin
			- platforms.txt lists ones included
		- all resource files
		- localization files
		- can be overridden to use filesystem if file newer by date?

start development on windows

unique monsters:
	- larger size
	- extra strong
	- extra fast
	- releases spell upon being hit
	- slows/slows upon being hit
	- burns/burns upon being hit
	- shocks/shocks upon being hit
	- minions

items:
	- unique items
	- stacks of items
	- unidentified
	- sets
	- random item attributes:
		- generic:
			- increased movement speed
			- max health/mana bonus
			- passive health/mana regen
			- gold drop bonus
			- magic item % drop bonus
		- armor:
			- armor class bonus
			- block bonus
		- weapon:
			- damage bonus
			- to hit bonus
			- health/mana steal
	- barrels:
		- like to come in large groups
		- hold nothing/few items
		- might be a trap (lone barrels will be traps more often than groups of barrels):
			- explode
			- cast spell
			- generate enemy (skeleton/zombie)
	- chests:
		- hold lots of items
		- glowy/gold chests hold more
		- can be a mimic in disguise, will attack player
		- mimics hold even more items than gold chests

random item tables, like diablo 2

pause game
pause only mobs/players
pause only spells/abilities

party:
	- follows you around
	- wanders a little, though
	- aggresive/defensive/passive?

mana/energy?
skills/stats

gold
shops
towns

loading screen?

menus:
	- main menu
	- settings menu

quests?

inventory:
	- spacious:
		- items take up space in a visual grid
		- bigger items take up more space
	- paper doll for equipt items
	- max carry weight, in addition to max space


external quest designer that quest developer could use, perferably GUI

use YAML to store data:
	- random item tables?
	- saved games
